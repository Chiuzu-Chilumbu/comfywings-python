# ComfyWings-Python: Test Tools Branch

Welcome to the Python version of the ComfyWings Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) project. This branch is specifically dedicated to the integration of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodologies. The development process in this branch adheres to a structured approach outlined below:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
   - Tests are meticulously crafted as the initial step in the development process.
   - Code implementation follows only after the successful completion of relevant test cases.
   
2. **Refactoring**:
   - Once the tests have been successfully passed and verified, the code is subjected to a refactoring phase.
   
3. **Second Refactoring**:
   - This phase primarily focuses on addressing Pylint errors, ensuring code quality, and enhancing overall codebase robustness.

Your contributions and adherence to these methodologies are highly encouraged, as they play a pivotal role in maintaining code integrity and promoting best practices within the ComfyWings Python project.
