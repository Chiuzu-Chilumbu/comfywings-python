# ComfyWings-Python: API Library Branch

Welcome to the Python version of the ComfyWings Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) project. The focus of this branch is the development of a library to manage data obtained from external APIs, specifically the integration of data sourced through the AMADEUS library. The key objectives of this branch include:

1. **API Integration**:
   - This branch is dedicated to seamlessly incorporating data from the external API into the ComfyWings project.
   - The primary mechanism for making API calls and retrieving data is through the utilization of the AMADEUS library.
