# ComfyWings-Python: API Explore Branch

Welcome to the Python version of the ComfyWings Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) project. This branch is specifically dedicated to the development of a library for managing data retrieved from external APIs. Noteworthy aspects of this branch include:

1. **API Integration**:
   - The core objective of this branch is to seamlessly incorporate external data sources into the ComfyWings project.
   - It is worth noting that API calls are executed using Python, without reliance on the AMADEUS library.

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - The branch leverages the Pytest testing framework to ensure robust testing and validation of API interactions and data handling.

3. **Integration with API Testing Repository**:
   - It is important to highlight that this branch was created concurrently with the API Testing Repository.
   - The API Testing Repository employs a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline within GitHub Actions.
   - This pipeline facilitates the comprehensive testing of APIs using Postman, where test suites are scripted in JavaScript.
